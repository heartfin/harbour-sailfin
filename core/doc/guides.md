\page guides Usage guides

\brief All guides intended for developers working with this library.

All guides assume familiarity with QML. If you aren't, [the free online QML book](https://www.qt.io/product/qt6/qml-book) is a great place to start.
Note that this book is written for Qt 6 QML, while this project is using Qt 5 QML.
The differences between those versions are not large, so it still is a valuable resource.
